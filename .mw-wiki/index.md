## Setup the data source

Joe is a software engineer who wants to be able to query a database and compare
it with a CSV file. 

He starts a react application on his laptop which also has a
postgres server running on it. 

He opens up http://localhost:3000/ and he sees a
form with username, password, databasename. He enters the credentials into the
form and hits submit.

He now sees a textarea in which he can write SQL. He types in 

```

SELECT * from foo

```
And nothing happens.
